# W10 - Web API Website

![banner](/assets/markdown_banner.png)

## 👋 Greetings!

This is a website I made called [NOTES](https://mockapinotes.netlify.app/), A simple note-keeping app using [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/) where you can create your list of ideas, editing your notes, or delete notes that you don't need anymore.
